# Camera2Forms
Xamarin Forms Implementation of the Camera2 namespace

This project contains an implementation of the camera2 namespace in Xamarin Forms
It doesnt contains the iOS version because iOS hasnt changed their camera namesapce and it is available on the internet.

In this example I merge this project

https://github.com/UNIT-23/Xam-Android-Camera2-Sample

with the google sample for camera2 which is in plain Xamarin

https://developer.xamarin.com/samples/monodroid/android5.0/Camera2Basic/

What is missing is the restart the Camera on Error and to close it and open it when the application goes and comes back from sleep.

Any help would be appreciated
